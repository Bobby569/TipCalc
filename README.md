Submitted by: **Yuchen (Bobby) Zhang**

Time spent: **~3** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
